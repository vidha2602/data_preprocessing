**Data Preprocessing Chatbot**

This project is a chatbot designed to assist with data preprocessing tasks such as merging or appending dataframes based on user commands. The chatbot leverages OpenAI's GPT-4-turbo model to understand user instructions and perform data operations on provided Excel files.

**Features**

_File Upload_: Users can upload two Excel files to be processed.

_Merging Dataframes_: The chatbot can merge two dataframes based on the similarity of embeddings for values in a specified key column.

_Appending Dataframes_: The chatbot can identify semantically similar columns and append them.
